# MMDiary
MMDiary Project


MMDiary is a secure personal information management application written in C++ using the Qt framework.


Features

Encrypted diary entries: Keep your thoughts private with AES-256-GCM encryption

Task management: Organize your tasks with customizable lists and notifications

Password manager: Securely store and manage your passwords

Data Encryptor: Allows you to encrypt any file you want and features a secure delete option with 3 passes.

Video Player: Currently only supports tv shows, will implement movies and more later on. 

Special: Built-in video player and vr video player for files in the encrypted data tab.


Architecture

MMDiary is built with the following technologies:


Qt 6.5.3: UI framework and core functionality

C++17: Modern C++ features for robust implementation

OpenSSL 3.5.0: Cryptography library for secure encryption

SQLite: Local database for user data storage


Build Requirements


Qt 6.5.3 or newer

MSVC 2019 64-bit compiler

Windows operating system (Windows-only application)

CMake 3.16+ (optional, if not using Qt Creator)

OpenSSL 3.5.0 (static libraries required)

libVLC 3.0+ (for video playback)

OpenVR 1.16+ (for VR support, optional)


Project Setup for Developers

## Prerequisites - Third-Party Dependencies

### 1. OpenSSL 3.5.0 (Required for AES-256-GCM Encryption)

**Static Linking Required**: This project requires OpenSSL to be statically linked for release builds.

#### Setup:
1. Download OpenSSL 3.5.0 static libraries for Windows x64 MSVC
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
MMDiary/
└── 3rdparty/
    └── openssl/
        ├── include/       # OpenSSL headers
        │   └── openssl/
        │       ├── aes.h
        │       ├── evp.h
        │       └── ... (other headers)
        └── lib/
            └── VC/
                └── x64/
                    └── MD/
                        ├── libssl_static.lib
                        └── libcrypto_static.lib
```

**Note**: For debug builds, the project uses system OpenSSL at `C:/Projects/OpenSSL-Win64`

### 2. libVLC (Required for Video Playback)

**Dynamic Linking**: libVLC is dynamically linked and requires runtime DLLs.

#### Setup:
1. Download VLC SDK 3.0+ for Windows x64
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
MMDiary/
└── 3rdparty/
    └── libvlc/
        ├── include/
        │   └── vlc/
        │       ├── vlc.h
        │       ├── libvlc.h
        │       └── ... (other headers)
        ├── lib/
        │   ├── libvlc.lib
        │   └── libvlccore.lib
        └── bin/
            ├── libvlc.dll
            ├── libvlccore.dll
            └── plugins/    # VLC plugins directory (required)
                ├── access/
                ├── audio_output/
                ├── codec/
                ├── video_output/
                └── ... (other plugin folders)
```

**Important**: The plugins directory is essential for video playback functionality.

### 3. OpenVR (Optional for VR Support)

**Dynamic Linking**: OpenVR support for SteamVR integration.

#### Setup:
1. Download OpenVR SDK 1.16+ from [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr)
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
MMDiary/
└── 3rdparty/
    └── openvr/
        ├── include/
        │   ├── openvr.h
        │   └── openvr_driver.h
        ├── lib/
        │   └── win64/
        │       └── openvr_api.lib
        └── bin/
            └── win64/
                └── openvr_api.dll
```

**Requirements for VR**: 
- SteamVR must be installed
- A compatible VR headset (HTC Vive, Valve Index, Oculus Rift, etc.)

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealMaPMaKeR/MMDiary.git
cd MMDiary
```

```
## Building with Qt Creator

1. Ensure all dependencies are properly placed in `3rdparty/` directory
2. Open MMDiary.pro in Qt Creator
3. Configure the project with a kit that includes Qt 6.5.3 and MSVC 2019 64-bit
4. Build the project
5. The build process will automatically copy required DLLs to the output directory

## Building from Command Line
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../MMDiary.pro
nmake  # or jom if available
```

**Post-Build**: The project automatically copies:
- VLC DLLs and plugins to the output directory
- OpenVR DLL to the output directory
- OpenSSL is statically linked (no DLLs needed for release)


## TMDB Integration for Developers

This project supports TMDB (The Movie Database) for automatic TV show metadata.

### Setup for Developers:
1. Get a free API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
2. Rename `tmdb_api_key_TEMPLATE.h` to `tmdb_api_key.h`
3. Replace the placeholder with your Read Access Token (Bearer token)
4. Recompile the application - the key will be embedded in your binary

Note: The `tmdb_api_key.h` file is gitignored. Never commit your actual API key.

Each developer needs their own TMDB API key.


Security Architecture

MMDiary employs several security measures to protect user data:


AES-256-GCM encryption: All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption.

PBKDF2 key derivation: Password-based keys are derived using 1,000,000 iterations for enhanced security.

In-memory protection: Encryption keys are securely wiped from memory when the application exits.

Input validation: Comprehensive validation prevents injection attacks and other security issues.

Path traversal protection: Strict file path validation prevents directory traversal attacks.

Temp files are stored in the app's folder, making it easy to have peace of mind that no decrypted file remains on disk.

Uses secure delete when deleting temporarily decrypted files.


Data Storage

User data is stored in the following locations:


Database: ./Data/MMDiary.db - Contains user accounts.

Database: ./Data/[username]/settings.db - Contains user settings.

Database: ./Data/[username]/persistent.db - Contains persistent settings (window location, size, etc)

Diary entries: ./Data/[username]/Diaries/[year]/[month]/[day]/*.txt - Encrypted diary files

Task lists: ./Data/[username]/TaskLists/*.txt - Encrypted task list files

Passwords: ./Data/[username]/Passwords/passwords.txt - Encrypted password storage

Encrypted Data: ./Data/[username]/EncryptedData/(Archives/Document/Image/Video) - Stores data encrypted by the user.

Videoplayer: ./Data/[username]/Videoplayer/Shows - Stores imported tv shows. (encrypted)

Temp files: ./Data/[username]/Temp and ./Data/[username]/Temp/tempdecrypt - stores temp files.

Temp locks: ./Data/[username]/temp_metadata_locks - used to store temp locks for the tv show player.

All files are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with user-specific keys.


Contributing

I am not accepting contributions right now since the project is personal and I want to retain full control over it.

I will revisit this once this software is more complete.
