## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup for Developers

## Prerequisites - Third-Party Dependencies

### 1. OpenSSL 3.5.0 (Required for AES-256-GCM Encryption)

**Static Linking Required**: This project requires OpenSSL to be statically linked for release builds.

#### Setup:
1. Download OpenSSL 3.5.0 static libraries for Windows x64 MSVC
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
MMDiary/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3rdparty/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openssl/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/       # OpenSSL headers
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openssl/
        ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aes.h
        ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ evp.h
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other headers)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ VC/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ x64/
                    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MD/
                        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libssl_static.lib
                        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libcrypto_static.lib
```

**Note**: For debug builds, the project uses system OpenSSL at `C:/Projects/OpenSSL-Win64`

### 2. libVLC (Required for Video Playback)

**Dynamic Linking**: libVLC is dynamically linked and requires runtime DLLs.

#### Setup:
1. Download VLC SDK 3.0+ for Windows x64
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
MMDiary/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3rdparty/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libvlc/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vlc/
        ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vlc.h
        ‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libvlc.h
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other headers)
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libvlc.lib
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ libvlccore.lib
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libvlc.dll
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libvlccore.dll
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/    # VLC plugins directory (required)
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ access/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio_output/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codec/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video_output/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other plugin folders)
```

**Important**: The plugins directory is essential for video playback functionality.

### 3. OpenVR (Optional for VR Support)

**Dynamic Linking**: OpenVR support for SteamVR integration.

#### Setup:
1. Download OpenVR SDK 1.16+ from [GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr)
2. Place the files in the following structure:
```
MMDiary/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3rdparty/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openvr/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openvr.h
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openvr_driver.h
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ win64/
        ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openvr_api.lib
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ win64/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ openvr_api.dll
```

**Requirements for VR**: 
- SteamVR must be installed
- A compatible VR headset (HTC Vive, Valve Index, Oculus Rift, etc.)

## Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealMaPMaKeR/MMDiary.git
cd MMDiary
```

## Building with Qt Creator

1. Ensure all dependencies are properly placed in `3rdparty/` directory
2. Open MMDiary.pro in Qt Creator
3. Configure the project with a kit that includes Qt 6.5.3 and MSVC 2019 64-bit
4. Build the project
5. The build process will automatically copy required DLLs to the output directory

## Building from Command Line
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../MMDiary.pro
nmake  # or jom if available
```

**Post-Build**: The project automatically copies:
- VLC DLLs and plugins to the output directory
- OpenVR DLL to the output directory
- OpenSSL is statically linked (no DLLs needed for release)


## TMDB Integration for Developers

This project supports TMDB (The Movie Database) for automatic TV show metadata.

### Setup for Developers:
1. Get a free API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
2. Rename `tmdb_api_key_TEMPLATE.h` to `tmdb_api_key.h`
3. Replace the placeholder with your Read Access Token (Bearer token)
4. Recompile the application - the key will be embedded in your binary

Note: The `tmdb_api_key.h` file is gitignored. Never commit your actual API key.

Each developer needs their own TMDB API key.


## üîí Security Architecture

MMDiary employs several security measures to protect user data:

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption** - All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation** - Password-based keys are derived using 1,000,000 iterations for enhanced security
- **In-Memory Protection** - Encryption keys are securely wiped from memory when the application exits
- **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation prevents injection attacks and other security issues
- **Path Traversal Protection** - Strict file path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Secure Temp Files** - Temporary files are stored in the app's folder, ensuring no decrypted data remains on disk
- **Secure Deletion** - Uses 3-pass overwrite when deleting temporarily decrypted files


## üìÇ Data Storage

User data is stored in the following locations:

### Database Files
- `./Data/MMDiary.db` - Contains user accounts
- `./Data/[username]/settings.db` - Contains user settings
- `./Data/[username]/persistent.db` - Contains persistent settings (window location, size, etc)

### User Data
- **Diary Entries:** `./Data/[username]/Diaries/[year]/[month]/[day]/*.txt` - Encrypted diary files
- **Task Lists:** `./Data/[username]/TaskLists/*.txt` - Encrypted task list files
- **Passwords:** `./Data/[username]/Passwords/passwords.txt` - Encrypted password storage
- **Encrypted Data:** `./Data/[username]/EncryptedData/(Archives/Document/Image/Video)` - User-encrypted files
- **Video Player:** `./Data/[username]/Videoplayer/Shows` - Imported TV shows (encrypted)

### Temporary Files
- **Temp Files:** `./Data/[username]/Temp` and `./Data/[username]/Temp/tempdecrypt`
- **Temp Locks:** `./Data/[username]/temp_metadata_locks` - TV show player metadata locks

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** All files are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with user-specific keys.


## ü§ù Contributing

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** I am not accepting contributions right now since the project is personal and I want to retain full control over it.

I will revisit this once the software is more complete.
