Creating Your Account


Data Security:
MMDiary takes your privacy seriously:

All data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM encryption
Your password never leaves your computer
Data is only decrypted when you need to access it
Your encryption key is securely wiped from memory on exit

Backup/Restore/Update:
Your data is stored in the Data folder where MMDiary is installed:

To backup: Copy the entire Data folder to a safe location
To restore: Replace the Data folder with your backup
To update: Move your Data folder to the new installation

You can also use the Show in File Explorer context menu option when you want to make backups of specific files.
It is useful because since the files use obfuscated names, it can be near impossible to know which is which.

You can delete persistentsettings.db and settings.db when the app is closed if you experience issues.
Doing so might solve them.
Never delete users.db , it is used to store your credentials.
Without it you would lose access to all your encrypted data.

Additional:
see the videoplayerkeybinds.txt file if you want to know all the available keybinds for the video players.
